# Homebrew Core
Core formulae for the Homebrew package manager.

## How do I install these formulae?
Just `brew install <formula>`. This is the default tap for Homebrew and is installed by default.

## Troubleshooting
First, please run `brew update` (twice) and `brew doctor`.

Second, read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting.html).

**If you don’t read these it will take us far longer to help you with your problem.**
