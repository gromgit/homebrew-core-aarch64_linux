    # The vmdktool Makefile isn't as well-behaved as we'd like:
    # 1) It defaults to man page installation in $PREFIX/man instead of
    #    $PREFIX/share/man, and doesn't recognize '$MANDIR' as a way to
    #    override this default.
    # 2) It doesn't do 'install -d' to create directories before installing
    #    to them.
    # The maintainer (Brian Somers, brian@awfulhak.org) has been notified
    # of these issues as of 2017-01-25 but no fix is yet forthcoming.
    # There is no public issue tracker for vmdktool that we know of.
    # In the meantime, we can work around these issues as follows:
    bin.mkpath
    man8.mkpath
    inreplace "Makefile", "man/man8", "share/man/man8"
