    # == LD_DYLIB_INSTALL_NAME Explanation ==
    # This make invocation calls xcodebuild, which in turn performs ad hoc code
    # signing. Note that ad hoc code signing does not need signing identities.
    # Brew will update binaries to ensure their internal paths are usable, but
    # modifying a code signed binary will invalidate the signature. To prevent
    # broken signing, this build specifies the target install name up front,
    # in which case brew doesn't perform its modifications.

  def caveats; <<~EOS
    Add the following line to ~/.lldbinit to load chisel when Xcode launches:
      command script import #{opt_libexec}/fblldb.py
    EOS
  end

  test do
    xcode_path = `xcode-select --print-path`.strip
    lldb_rel_path = "Contents/SharedFrameworks/LLDB.framework/Resources/Python"
    ENV["PYTHONPATH"] = "#{xcode_path}/../../#{lldb_rel_path}"
    system "python", "#{libexec}/fblldb.py"
  end
end
