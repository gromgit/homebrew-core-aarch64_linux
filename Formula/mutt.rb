# Note: Mutt has a large number of non-upstream patches available for
# it, some of which conflict with each other. These patches are also
# not kept up-to-date when new versions of mutt (occasionally) come
# out.
#
# To reduce Homebrew's maintenance burden, patches are not accepted
# for this formula. The NeoMutt project has a Homebrew tap for their
# patched version of Mutt: https://github.com/neomutt/homebrew-neomutt
